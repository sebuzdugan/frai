## üìã Why Use Framework-RAI?

Responsible AI shouldn't be a burden. This framework helps you:

- **Save Time**: No lengthy forms or complex processes
- **Ensure Compliance**: Cover essential ethical and regulatory requirements
- **Improve Documentation**: Create clear, consistent documentation
- **Get Actionable Advice**: Receive practical tips tailored to your AI feature

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g framework-rai

# Or use without installing
npx framework-rai
```

### Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key

The first time you run the tool, it will prompt you to set up your OpenAI API key. You can also configure it explicitly:

```bash
# Initial setup wizard (interactive)
npx framework-rai --setup

# Set up a global key (used across all projects)
npx framework-rai --setup --global

# Run with a specific key without saving it
npx framework-rai --key=your-api-key-here
```

#### API Key Storage Options

- **Project-specific**: Stored in `.env` in your project directory (default)
- **Global**: Stored in `~/.config/framework-rai/config` (works across all projects)
- **Session-only**: Use the `--key` option for temporary use without saving

## üìù Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the CLI tool in your project directory:

```bash
# If installed globally
ai-responsible

# Or using npx
npx framework-rai
```

Answer the simple questions about your AI feature, and the framework will generate three markdown files:

- `checklist.md`
- `model_card.md`
- `risk_file.md`

### CLI Options

```bash
# Basic usage
npx framework-rai

# Configure API key (interactive)
npx framework-rai --setup

# Use a global API key (shared between projects)
npx framework-rai --global

# Specify an API key directly (won't be saved)
npx framework-rai --key=your-api-key-here

# Combine options
npx framework-rai --global --setup
```

### Pre-commit Hook (Recommended)

For automatic checks before each commit, install [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/):

```bash
# Install Husky
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky init

# Add the pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx framework-rai"
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **Detection**: Identifies if a commit introduces or modifies an AI feature
2. **Documentation**: Guides you through minimal, high-impact questions
3. **Generation**: Creates three essential markdown files
4. **AI Tips**: Provides 2-3 practical tips per category using OpenAI's API
5. **Integration**: Works with your existing workflow via pre-commit hooks or manual runs

## üß† Example Output

### checklist.md

```markdown
# Responsible AI Feature Checklist

This AI feature is mainly for internal analytics, using personal data with consent. 
Monitoring approach: user feedback.

## Tips
Checklist Tips:
- Implement a consent management system to track and verify user consent for personal data.
- Document your user feedback collection process in the README.
```

### model_card.md

```markdown
# Model Card

Model type: NLP/Language. Key metric: F1 Score. Main limitation: Data bias.

## Tips
Model Card Tips:
- Include a section on data bias in your model card, detailing specific biases identified.
- Add F1 score benchmarks for different demographic groups to identify potential disparities.
```

## üìä Metrics & KPIs

The framework tracks three key ethical KPIs:
1. **Model Transparency**: Presence of model documentation
2. **Bias & Fairness**: Consideration of potential biases
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Implementation of feedback mechanisms
